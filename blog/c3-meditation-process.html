  <h3> Chapter 2 of "Search Inside yourself"</h3>
  <h4> By Chade-Meng Tan</h4>

  <ul class="a">

    <h3> How did the 'process over product' concept affect your site rebuild?</h3>

    <p>
  I was able to work to a plan before implementing the results. It was an outline that I creatd and my goal was to see that outline come to life, although difficult trying to bring the idea to life on the website.
    </p>

    <h3> What did you think about meditation before reading the chapter?</h3>

<p>
Before reading the chapter, I thought meditation was a form of relaxation, a way to calm the mind and therefore live  a life full freedom and self expression.</p>


    <h3> What new things hav you learn't about meditaton?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Meta attention is attention of attention, basically the ability to pay attention to attention itself.</li>
      <li>Meditation gets you to a state where your mind is relaxed and alert at the same time.</li>
      <li>When attention and meta-attention becomes strong, the mind becomes focused and stable.</li>
      <li>When the mind is highly relaxed and alert, qualities such as calmness, clarity and happiness emerge.</li>
      <li>Meditation is exercising the mind; training the mind so that it can gain more mental abilites.</li>
      <li>After a few months of meditation, there is significant improvements with a persons health.</li>
      <li>Creating good intentions is a form of meditation. Everytime an intention is created, it is subtly forming or reinforcing a mental habit.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3> Did any of the suggested Meditation techniques stand out?</h3>
    <p>
      In the case of a distraction, when I feel my mind begin to wonder, I need to first pay attention to that distraction by acknowledging the distraction. Experience it without judging or reacting and then let it go and slowly come back to a sense of mindfulness.</p>

      <h3> Any other musings</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoyed reading the analogies, especially the "Grandmother mind" intention who is the ideal candidate if you're feeling down because they are the type of idea that you need to boost your self esteem.</p>
