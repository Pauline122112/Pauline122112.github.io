    <h3> What is grid based design</h3>

    <p>
    Grid based design is the use of sophisticated layout structures that can enhance the visual experience for someone visiting your site.
    </p>

    <h3> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>

<p>
In order to have more clients visiting your page, a Web developer needs to take into consideration that not every user will have a computer to view the website and that other tech devices such as a smart phone or I-pad should also be taken into consideration. This practice incorporates layout design, the use of images and a confident approach to Cascading Style Sheets. The website should be able to automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. </p>


    <h3> What is semantic Structure?</h3>

    <p>
  Semantic structure is when the element in an HTML tag conveys information about the content contained between the opening and closing tags. For example, an h1 tag is the most important header of a specific web page or section.
    </p>

    <h3> Any other points of interest?</h3>
    <p>
      As a Graphic Designer, I want to be able to incorporate web design software such as Dreamweaver or Fireworks. Areas that Iâ€™m not very familiar with but feel are important to know. </p>
