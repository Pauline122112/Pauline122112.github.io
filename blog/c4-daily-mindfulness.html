    <h3> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>

    <p>
  I recently tried 'mindfulness conversation' with my husband. My husband is a 'clean freak' and he has now implemented a cleaning regime that we need to stick to every Sunday. Yesterday, I implemented the 'mindfulness conversation' to my husband with full disclosure. At first he was skeptical because he thought I would fail, because I never listen when it comes to cleaning. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and allowed him to speak for three minutes explaining what chores were for the day while I listened and there was nil interuptions. I noticed at times my mind would begin invisioning how best to approach the jobs and how long it should take me, he took notice of that and would ask if I was paying attention, to which, I snapped back to the task at hand which was for him to have my full attention. After he had finished going over the chores that I needed to do and what cleaning products to use and how to properly "clean". I reiterated to the best of my ability what he had said. He did have to correct me on some parts, he did make me repeat it again and then he was satisfied with my understanding and then we dispensed on the work. My husband seemed quite please with the outcome.

    <h3>  Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>

<p> The technique that I will use to sustain my practice is 'dipping'. I find that I'm a person that can be easily distracted while listening and I feel I need to notice those feelings; acknowlege that I have noticed the feelings and then allow for the feelings to disappear. I have found full eye contact does help me to stay focused. </p>

<h4> Any other musings?</h4>

  <p> Mastering both focused and open attention requires a balance of effor and relaxation. Can be compared to circuit training for athletes where it starts with focused attention exercises such as cardio, and then goes to an open attention exercise such as resistance training.<p/>
    <p>
    Understanding initial access and colidation. Anitial access is where you are able to access a short term state of mind. Consolidation is where you are constantly trying to maintain a particular state of mind in what seems like meaningless progress, but then all of a sudden, you make progress and arrive at full consolidation. The idea is to constantly practice.
