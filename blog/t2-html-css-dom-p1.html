    <h1>My Udacity Reflection Part 1 </h1>

    <h3> Describe HTML, CSS AND DOM to a Non-Technical Friend?</h3>
   <p>
     HTML, CSS and Dom is like a game of Netball.

Amy wants to play Netball but has never played before. A teacher explains to Amy the fundamentals (HTML) of the game.  There is a court 100 feet long and 50 feet wide and it is divided lengthwise into thirds. There is a ball and a 10-foot standing post with a hoop at each end of the court.

In the team there are seven players (Tag) that form positions (elements)-

Goal Shoot
Goal Attack
Wing Attack
Center
Wing Defense
Goal Defense
Goal Keep

From these positions, the players learn skills, drills and plays (Content)

So now that Amy has been told the fundamentals of the game, Amy is still unsure of how the game should look. There is a game being played between the Blue team and Red team. The blue team is wearing a Blue Uniform and the Red team is wearing a Red Uniform to distinguish what teams they belong to. (CSS)

Amy is beginning to understand a lot about Netball and wonders who assigns the different positions to these players. That is where the coach (DOM) comes in. The coach can set plays, change players from one position to another. Determine which players work well with each other. The players look to the coach for help in order to have a successful game.
