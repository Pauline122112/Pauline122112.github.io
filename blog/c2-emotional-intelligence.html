    <h3> What did you learn from the first chapter?</h3>
    <p>
    Learning’s I took from the chapter was a basic understanding of Emotional Intelligence. Knowing oneself lies at the core of emotional intelligence, it is basically mind training in mindfulness. The practice of mindfulness is basically a gateway into the experience of interconnectedness and interdependence of which stem emotional intelligent actions, such as kindness and compassion.

    <h3> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
      I found the exercise quite difficult, even though it was for two minutes; I tried to use the “Easy way” approach where my attention was on breathing. However, when I did try to concentrate, something would take my attention away and then I felt as though I would have to force myself back to concentrating on my breathing by taking deep and loud breaths to keep my focus. Two minutes did feel like an eternity and I was actually glad when time was up. I believe the idea of “Learning to just be” will be beneficial for me, if I continue to do this for two minutes each day, improvements in my concentration and creativeness will improve.
