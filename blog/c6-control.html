    <h3> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>

    <p>
      While programming, some triggers that cause a disproportionate emotional response within me is when I overthink an assignment, and begin to blame myself for overthinking how to approach the assignment, the idea that I'm not good enough and "why am I putting myself through this" also come to mind, but once it's solved, It almost feels as though the end of the world has come and gone. This frequently happens. The idea that this one task feels like the end of the world for me is a constant thorn in my side.

    <h3>  How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)? </h3>

<p> I found the "Siberian North Railroad " exercise to primarily focus on the breathing. It helped me to calm down and therefore I was able to reflect on the issues that had triggered my emotional response with a clear observation, reminding myself that, "It is not the end of the world", and "the more I practice, the easier it will become". I was in a state of discouragement today and it wasn't until I started to slow my breathing down and really think about the situation that I started to realise that I didn't want to be discouraged any more. I was able to acknowledge the fair that had possessed me all day, and to realise, that what I was think was illogical and will have no impact on my future and all I really wanted to do was to live in a world full of freedom and self expression.
