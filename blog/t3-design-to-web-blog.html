    <h3> What's a responsive site? Why is it important? </h3>

    <p>
    It's an approach to making website pages look great an any size. Devices, platforms and browser are expanding, therefore responsive sites are a way to stay current.
    </p>

    <h3> What is mobile first design? Why is it important?</h3>

<p>
Designing for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. If a site looks good on a mobile device, it can translate better to all devices. </p>

    <h3> What is a Wireframe? Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>
      When you plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colours or typefaces. A wireframe is simple to create and should provide enough detail so that the client can understand how the website will be presented. </p>

      <h3> What aspects of my wireframe I found hard to implement? Why?</h3>
      <p>
        Alignment of the content. I'm still trying to figure out the sections, and still trying to piece together what goes where, but I'm confident that I will be in control and able to find a solution sufficiently.  </p>
