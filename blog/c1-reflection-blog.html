    <h1>In the beginning </h1>
    <h2>My impressions of EDA </h2>
    <h3>03 December 2016</h3>

    <h4> What is your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
   <p>
    The EDA experience so far is fasinating. In reference to the video where
    Shereef explains the fundamentals of the course and how he draws on two mind sets.
    The first one is the Restaurant/Consumer Mindset where you are given the impression that Bootcamp is a package and therefore, your expectations are high. The second mindset is known as the "Kitchen Mindset" where we have all come together to experience together, some of us are cooks with more experience and some of us have just picked up a chopping knife for the first time. But we all have our aprons and hats and we're all coming together to make this stew together.
    I draw parallels with the second mindset. It reminded me of when I first learnt how to speak Korean, and having to actively seek help from my peers who knew more then me and working together so that we were pushing each other, to better ourselves and to prove to myself that it is possible if I'm well prepared and eager to learn.
    </p>

    <h4> What are your impressions?</h4>

    <p>
      My impression so far is that there is an excellent support system to ensure that we meet our goals and if I stay positive and motivated then everything will be okay.
    </p>

    <h4> How do you see yourself engaging in this type of culture?</h4>
    <p>
      Always asking for help and giving my support in return, learning new ideas and networking with my peers and teachers so that we're able to work together to see our goals become a reality. This is the mindset that will help me engage in this type of culture.
    </p>

    <h4> Have your expectations of EDA changed? if so, how?</h4>
    <p>
    My initial expectation of EDA was that it would predominantly be a lecture based style of learning, consisting of resources that would need to be memorized etc. That is not the case with EDA, the projects are fun and interesting, not to say that they are easy, because for myself, it has been quite difficult, but of course, I expected that when learning new material. But to have an element of "fun" within the folds of learning has definitely exceeded my expectations.
    </p>

    <h4> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm definitely excited to be learning and participating in this kind of learning environemnt. It is intimidating and nerve-racking, but I am prepared to be challenged. It's like living in a new country for the first time. Intimidating because you don't know anyone and you're not confident in the language, nerve-racking because you're stepping out of your comfort zone, therefore, the idea of having to learn quickly can be exhilerating.
