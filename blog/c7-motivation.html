    <h1> The Art Of Self Motivation </h1>


  <ul class="a">

    <h3>  How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>

<p> There are three types of happiness which can be described as pleasure, passion
  and purpose. Acknowleging these three distinction will lead to what we see as a
  meaningful higher purpose in our lives. When this develops, our work can become
  a source of sustainable happiness for us.
</p>

<h3> Discovering values and higher purpose </h3>
<dl>
    <dt><strong> What are your core values?</strong>
      <dd>
      My core values are to ensure I manage everything with integrity. To always
      ask questions if I'm unsure. To help and support people. To acknowledge my
      own faults.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you stand for?</strong>
      <dd>
      In regards to my background, being indigenous, I stand for the rights of my
      Indigenous whanau, I stand to make a difference. To give my people an opportunity
      to express themselves through the creative arts and web development. I stand
      to change the way many in this country view my people as a stereotype.
      I stand to make a difference, and to see change.
      </dd>

<h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
<p> I found the calming to be frustrating to begin with. Having to think of a situation
  where I failed made me feel uncomfortable. Usually, I am able to compartmentalise
  situations that have impacted me in a negative way. The thought that I had to provoke
  a failed situation was difficult to hold on to for a long time because I was not use
  to acknowledging the situation. When it came to acknowledging success. I found to relax
  a lot more. Overall, I found it relaxing, but I do feel it is something that I will
  continuously need to practice.
 </p>
<h3>Any other muses?</h3>
  <p> The idea of learning Optimism and unlearning Pessimism really struck a cord
    with me. I found that sometimes I exhibited Pessimistic traits but I feel we
    are people who think this way collectively, and yes, Optimism can be taught and
    I think thats what is difficult for people like myself to grasp, that something
    so simple can be learn't, yet, I have not taken the time to learn it, until now.
