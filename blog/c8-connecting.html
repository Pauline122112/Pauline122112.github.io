    <h1> EMPATHY </h1>


  <ul class="a">

    <h3> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>

    <p> The techniques for growing trust and sincerity enabled the other person to feel acknowledged and therefore abel to
      trust more effectively, trust begins with sincereity, kindness and openness.

    </p>

    <h3>  How was the Emphatic Listening? </h3>

<p> I tried this approach with my husband. We had a disaggreement over something frivolous, and I was able to use the
approach and to see what he was seeing using empathy. I wanted him to be well, happy and free from suffering. Afterwards, I forgotten why I was
being bitter and found that I was happy, much to the amase of my husband.  </p>

<h3>  How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>

  <p> I found it interesting. I Believe it is an area that needs to be revisited </p>

  <h3>  Complete the political awareness exercise </h3>
  <p> I actually completed this exercise with my husband where I had explained to him about
  my disagreement in regards to a certain subject and how it made me unhappy, then I reflected and
looked at the situation from his point of view and explained it to him like I was him, therefore gaining
empathy because I could understand where he was coming from. I found this helps to make our relationship stronger. </p>

<h3> Muse? </h3>
<p> Empathy is something you can improve with practice and most of that practice involves mindulness and creating mental habits.
I will try to obtain the idea of being 'kind'.</p>
