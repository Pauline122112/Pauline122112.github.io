    <h3> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>

    <p> The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is that both compliment each or they are seen as the same thing. In Mindfulness, you're paying attention in a particular way which is 'trainable', and with Self Awareness, it maintains a self-reflectiveness that is essentially 'Mindfulness', which means, it is a system that is also 'trainable'.

    </p>

    <h3>  Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </h3>

<p> The self awareness practice that I tried from this chapter was the 'Journaling' practice. The practice of self discovery by writing to yourself. I wrote about "Things that annoy me" for two minutes and "My weaknesses" for two minutes, I then concluded the exercise by reviewing both entries for two minutes. I found it to be an intersting experience. It felt good to be given the opportunity to basically "vent" my frustrations. I feel lighter, rereading what I had written allowed me to understand some of the issues I have stored in my head, allowing to see it on paper gave me a sense of relief, acknowledging the issues I have, and building a solution to become more adequate and not having to indulge on the issue any further because the sense that the issue has been passed from my brain to paper has allowed for a pleasant short-term euphoria which if I continue with this practice on a daily basis, then the euphoric feeling can be present on a long term scale. </p>

<h3> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>

  <p> Emotions are not what make us who we are. To the mind, our emotions become our existence. If I continue to use mindfulness practice, I will begin to feel that emotions are simply what I feel and it doesn't make me who I am as a person. </p>
