    <h1> PROBLEM SOLVING </h1>


  <ul class="a">

    <h3> YOU'VE BEEN BLOCKED!</h3>

    <p> And no I don't mean the 'facebook' type of block where you have a disagreement with another user who you are friends with on the social media site, and that friend becomes outraged and decides that he/she wants to block you so it feels like you never existed to them. No, I mean the other block, the one that provides mental challenges that you're able to overcome and progress quite sufficiently through, until you are hit by an ever-growing psychological "wall". As much as you try to solve the problem, the invisible wall is staying strong and intact. Sometimes it can only be rectified through time where after some much needed rest and recovery, an idea hits you out of no where or if it is still continuous then the next resort would have to be support from colleagues. I would say "getting blocked" would be a professional's worst nightmare while working on an assignment or project that has a time limit.

  <h3> Example of a problem during Sprint 5 </h3>
  <p> There were a few issues that I had during my experience of Sprint 5. One example of a problem that arose during Sprint 5 was having to create a "prompt" game about Justin Bieber. I was able to work through the assignment, smoothly. One part that I found difficult was when I had to copy and paste a string to the console of my 'if' statement and checking to make sure it was correct always seem to come back with an error saying "it is not a function" I tried for 20 minutes trying to rectify the problem myself, changing parts of my code only seemed to make it worse so I knew I must have been on the right track some how, but I could not understand what the problem was. </p>

  <p> After 30 minutes of becoming frustrated and allowing some time to clear my head by going for a walk. I knew that I had to rectify the problem by searching google. It seemed I was not the only one with the problem. The problem solving technique that I needed to use and should be accustomed to now is the refresh button. My code was correct, however the reason why it was coming up with that particular error was because it needed to be refreshed. So I refreshed the page and 'lo and behold' it worked.</p>

  <p> The time it took for me to find the solution on my own, the longer I felt like I was beginning to doubt myself that I had actually understood the question. I realized that I need to stay confident, and I need to keep pushing myself so that it becomes easier.</p>

  <h3> Problem Solving Techniques!</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Pseudocode</strong>
    <dd>I think Pseudocode is useful and will be beneficial once I am more active in this field.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Trying Something</strong>
      <dd> I've always been able to try something. It can be daunting because I always think "what if" something negative happens and I'm unable to understand, but I enjoy the idea of being challenged, the idea of learning something new is daunting but I'm perservaring.</dd>
    <dt><strong> Rubber ducky method</strong>
      <dd>I haven't tried the 'Rubber ducky method' as of yet but looking forward to the day I will.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Reading error messages</strong>
      <dd>I became accustomed to reading error messages while working through the
      'never ending' javascript activities during Sprint 4. I became so accustomed that with some of the error messages I knew what the exact problem was. It allowed for me to edit my code.</dd>
    <dt><strong> Console.logging</strong>
      <dd>Enjoy using console.log, I know that anything printed in console.log, is seen on the live site by users.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Googling</strong>
      <dd>Googling became my best friend when I "hit the wall", I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is facing problems.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
      <dd>I haven't had to ask my peers for help during this sprint because what help I needed was answered when I googled the problem. I have needed my cohorts support with other sprints where they are always helpful and eager.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
      <dd>In the beginning I was constantly asking my coach for help, but now I see asking the leader for help as a last resort. I haven't had to ask for help during my recent sprint encounters.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
      <dd>Reflecting is like writing a journal entry for me, able to get what has been on my mind and release it to the world. It always for me to reflect on what I need to improve on and what I have accomplished.</dd>

<h3> Functions</h3>

  <dt><strong>What is .map()</strong>
    <dd>
      It is a method that uses a 'callback' function for each element in an array. It's able to construct a new array for the results.
    </dd>

  <dt><strong>What is .filter()</strong>
    <dd>
      It is a method that creates a new array with all elements from a previous function that are correct. If the function comes back 'incorrect' then it will not be included in the new array.
    </dd>

  <dt><strong>What is .reduce()</strong>
    <dd>
      It is a method that applies a function where it goes through each element of an array and reduces the element with the help of a function.
    </dd>
