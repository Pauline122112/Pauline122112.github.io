    <h1> PROBLEM SOLVING </h1>


  <ul class="a">

    <h3> YOU'VE BEEN BLOCKED!</h3>

    <p> And no I don't mean the 'facebook' type of block where you have a disagreement with another user who you are friends with on the social media site, and that friend becomes outraged and decides that he/she wants to block you so it feels like you never existed to them. No, I mean the other block, the one that provides mental challenges that you're able to overcome and progress quite sufficiently through, until you are hit by an ever-growing psychological "wall". As much as you try to solve the problem, the invisible wall is staying strong and intact. Sometimes it can only be rectified through time where after some much needed rest and recovery, an idea hits you out of no where or if it is still continuous then the next resort would have to be support from colleagues. I would say "getting blocked" would be a professional's worst nightmare while working on an assignment or project that has a time limit.

  <h3> Example of a problem during Sprint 5 </h3>
  <p> There were a few issues that I had during my experience of Sprint 5. One example of a problem that arose during Sprint 5 was having to create a "prompt" game about Justin Bieber. I was able to work through the assignment, smoothly. One part that I found difficult was when I had to copy and paste a string to the console of my 'if' statement and checking to make sure it was correct always seem to come back with an error saying "it is not a function" I tried for 20 minutes trying to rectify the problem myself, changing parts of my code only seemed to make it worse so I knew I must have been on the right track some how, but I could not understand what the problem was. </p>

  <p> After 30 minutes of becoming frustrated and allowing some time to clear my head by going for a walk. I knew that I had to rectify the problem by searching google. It seemed I was not the only one with the problem. The problem solving technique that I needed to use and should be accustomed to now is the refresh button. My code was correct, however the reason why it was coming up with that particular error was because it needed to be refreshed. So I refreshed the page and 'lo and behold' it worked.</p>

  <p> The time it took for me to find the solution on my own, the longer I felt like I was beginning to doubt myself that I had actually understood the question. I realized that I need to stay confident, and I need to keep pushing myself so that it becomes easier.</p>

    <dt>YES, then how will you get to the game?</dt>
