    <h1> LEADERSHIP </h1>

      <ul class="a">

      <h3> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>

      <p>
        My experience of compassionate leadership is that the idea to be ambitious but also compassion for other members is the best form of leadership. If everyone is on the same 'page' and working
        to a system that is motivating then the success rate is higher.
      </p>

     <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>

     <p>
       I found it relaxing, found that my mind was more opened and improve. An area I would thoroughly
       like to explore
     </p>

     <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>

     <p>
       To be honest, it actually started to make me tired. The idea of internalising all the negative
       energy I guess was a mental weight for me, having to bare it is easy, trying to release or let go
       was difficult and I guess, that was why I become very tired. I would like to explore this more and
       continue to improve, everyday. I know that I have a lot of struggles in my life that I would like
       to release or improve on.
      </p>

     <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
     <p>
       Relates to how we are able to improve our selves with the course work and how we can improve ourselves as people. Also acknowledging the work other people have put in also a driving mechanism to 'do' better.
     </p>
     <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
     <p>
       Had issues that needed to be addressed with a family member, was able to address the issue. Took time to listen to the family member's point of view. In the end we were able to come to an agreement which is only short term but with more communication I'm hoping that we will be able to be more open with each other.
     </p>

     <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
     <p>
       The 'Magic Mushroom Mantra' is very ideal where it speaks of " “Love them. Understand them. Forgive them. Grow with them.” So whenever I'm faced with a difficult situation, I will silently repeat the mantra to myself.
