    <h3> What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.</h3>

    <p> Scope is the current context of your code. Scope helps you to understand more about variables and functions. Basically it keeps your code clean and you're able to write faster and maintain a manageable code. Scope can be defined in two ways: Global or local.</p>
      <dl>
          <dt><strong>Global scope</strong>
          <dd>When a variable is declared outside of a function definition, the value is accessable and modifiable throughout the program.</dd>
          <dt><strong>Local scope</strong>
          <dd>Is when a variable is declared inside a function definition. There is typically one gloabl scope, and each function defined has its own (nested) local scope, for exampe, if I define a function and create a variable inside that function, then those variables become locally scoped. </dd>
        </dl>
