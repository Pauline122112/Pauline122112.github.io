    <h2>The mindset of time management </h2>
    <h3>03 December 2016</h3>

    <h4> Which "Timebox and habits" techniques did you try?</h4>
   <p>
     The Timebox and habits techniques that I tried were Meditation, Habits and growth mindset, The Pomodoro technique and TimeBox.
    </p>

    <h4> What did you find interesting?</h4>

    <p>
      I found the Pomodoro Technique to be quite interesting. The idea that you will set the time to work for 25 minutes without interrupting myself seems like a technique that I would like to aquire. This technique will enable me to work with time and not against it. Eliminating the idea of becoming "burnt out".
      Managing distractions whether it's a call or social media updates.This technique will help me to log my distractions in order of priority. I hope to lead a balanced lifestyle and create a better work environment by using this technique.
    </p>

    <h4> What worked for you?</h4>
    <p>
      The Pomodore technique obviously works for me, however, I do hold high consideration for Meditation as I try to use this technique on a daily basis.
    </p>

    <h4> Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
    <p>
    I will be experiment further with the Pomodore Technique, I hope to save a lot of time using this technique.
